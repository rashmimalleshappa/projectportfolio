# Purchases, Sales and Inventory

This project showcases my ability to leverage Power BI for comprehensive business analysis. I integrated data from three independent sources (Purchases, Receiving, Billing) to create a single-page summary with key performance indicators (KPIs) for a warehouse.

The Purchases data tells us when we ordered products and how many, while Receiving data reveals how long it takes for goods to arrive after placing an order. Then, we analyze Billing data to see how quickly we invoice customers after receiving goods.
Data Transformation and Modelling-Â 
1. Imported tables from the dataset
2. Extended Date Table was added as [Date]
3. Identified Fact and Dimension tables
4. Created Duplicates for Purchasing and Receiving for creating a separate table for unique Customers and Materials (Lookup tables)
5. Created relationships between all the tables
6. A new table was derived by merging the Purchases and Receiving tables for the calculation of time elapsed between purchase orders and receiving.
