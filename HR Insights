# Problem Statement
The HR department lacks the ability to analyze employee feedback on policy consultations.  Currently, data exists on consultations but there are no reports to understand employee reception, track changes in feedback between interviews, or identify other relevant metrics.

# Steps taken
1. Processed the exported consultation data from the HR system.
2. Developed a report that analyzed employee feedback on policy consultations including

a. Overall reception of the proposed changes

b. Change in employee sentiment between the first and second interview.

3. Identified and include other relevant metrics for the report, potentially including:
Number of consultations conducted.
Frequency of specific feedback themes.
4. Generated a report that are clear, concise, and visually appealing for presentation to superiors.

# Key Insights-
1. There is a overall positive change in response from Interview 1 to Interview 2
2. According to the outcome score, Consultations- Working hours and Pay Policy both have the most negative responses.
